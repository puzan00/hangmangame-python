# hangmangame-python
This is a hangman game that randomly chooses words from a list of words and the player has to guess the words. 
The player has a limited number of lives, and each incorrect guess reduces the number of lives. 
The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives. 
It also has a hint feature that reveals letters in words.
I have given two chances for the hint for guessing each word.
